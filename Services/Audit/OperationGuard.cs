// FILE: Services/Audit/OperationGuard.cs
// PROJECT: ProGlassAutomation
// MODULE: Core — service-layer authorization (audit finding A-1)
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG
// ──────────────
// Permission checks existed in EIGHTEEN places, and every one of them
// was in a ViewModel. Zero checks existed in the service or repository
// layer. Meanwhile there are THIRTY-SEVEN mutating repository methods
// (Insert/Update/Delete/SaveOrUpdate across 8 repositories).
//
// The brief states the rule plainly: "Never rely only on hiding a
// button. Authorization must also exist at the operation/service layer."
// It was not. Any caller that reached a repository directly — the AI
// agent's tool layer, a background task, a future feature, or simply a
// ViewModel whose author forgot the check — performed the write with no
// permission evaluation at all.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE TYPE RATHER THAN REUSING PermissionService.Require
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// PermissionService.Require() calls MessageBox.Show(). That is correct
// for a ViewModel and WRONG for a service:
//
//   • It blocks a background thread on a modal UI dialog.
//   • It hard-couples the data layer to WPF.
//   • It cannot be unit-tested without a message pump.
//   • It would show a SECOND dialog when the ViewModel has already
//     shown one, so a denied action would pop twice.
//
// OperationGuard is the headless equivalent: it evaluates the same
// RolePermissions map, writes the same audit entry, and THROWS instead
// of showing UI. The ViewModel layer keeps Require() for the friendly
// dialog; the service layer gets a hard boundary that cannot be
// bypassed by forgetting a call in the UI.
//
// DEFENCE IN DEPTH, NOT A REPLACEMENT
// ───────────────────────────────────
// The existing 18 ViewModel checks are deliberately left in place. They
// give the user a clear explanation before anything happens. This guard
// is the backstop that makes the rule actually enforced. Two layers,
// each doing what it is good at.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED
// ───────────
// If no user is signed in, CurrentUser is null and RolePermissions.For
// returns an empty set, so every permission evaluates to DENY. That is
// the correct default for a security gate: absence of identity must
// never mean absence of restriction.
