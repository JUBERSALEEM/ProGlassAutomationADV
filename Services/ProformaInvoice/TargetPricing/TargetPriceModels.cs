// PROJECT: ProGlassAutomation
// MODULE: Shared target-price calculation model (Step 9 & Job Profitability)
//
// AUTHORITATIVE BUSINESS MODEL (approved by the customer):
//   • The GIVEN selling price is the Step 5 specification Base Price.
//   • The SPECIFICATION TARGET is the Step 4 specification formula result
//     lifted by the approved target uplift (15%):
//         DGU: ((Outer Glass Rate + Inner Glass Rate) ÷ Yield + ASP Rate) × 1.15
//   • U-INSERT ACCOUNTING (revised 2026-09-04 — the Step 6 row toggle
//     decides the treatment; the required target NEVER moves):
//         Toggle ON  (Treatment = Additional): the U-insert is billed as its
//             own Step 6 line on top of the given price — the FINAL REQUIRED
//             TARGET stays the NORMAL specification target and the rate is
//             display-only.
//         Toggle OFF (Treatment = IncludedInStep5Price): the U-insert is
//             covered INSIDE the Step 5 given price (the customer is quoted
//             one all-in price) — the FINAL REQUIRED TARGET STILL stays the
//             NORMAL specification target. Adding the rate would double-count
//             it: the given price already includes the U-insert, so the KPI
//             would punish a profitable quotation (e.g. 125 given ≈ 20% over
//             a 103.82 basis judged against a folded 129.39 instead of the
//             base-price 119.39). The rate is visible on the KPI as
//             informational only.
//   • THE KPI TRIGGER IS THE BASE PRICE (approved 2026-09-04): the
//     pre-uplift specification formula result, computed EXACTLY from the
//     Step 4 component rates and the Step 9 yield factor — never derived
//     from example prices:
//         Base Price (DGU) = (Outer Glass Rate + Inner Glass Rate) ÷ Yield + ASP
//         e.g. (25 + 25) ÷ 0.85 + 45 = 103.82   →   × 1.15 = 119.39 target
//   • MARGIN AGAINST TARGET = the toggle-resolved judgement over that base:
//         Given judged for the margin =
//             Given Price                        (U-insert billed separately
//                                                  — Step 6 row ACTIVE)
//             Given Price − U-insert rate        (U-insert covered INSIDE the
//                                                  given price — Step 6 row OFF)
//         Extra profit vs base (AED/m²) = Given judged − Base Price
//         Margin over base %            = (Given judged − Base Price) ÷ Base Price × 100
//     Example: given 125 on the 103.82 basis → +21.18 AED/m² (+20.40%) when
//     the U-insert is a separate Step 6 charge; 125 − 10 = 115 → +11.18
//     AED/m² (+10.77%) when the U-insert is inside the given. The margin is
//     judged on the GIVEN price against the BASE price — never against the
//     final required target (that comparison would read 125 vs 119.39 and
//     hide the U-insert giveaway entirely).
//   • The required-target margin (Given vs Final Required Target) is still
//     computed and still drives the ABOVE/BELOW/AT-TARGET status pills —
//     it is the status signal, not the KPI headline.
//
// These types are deliberately immutable POCOs (no WPF dependency) so the
// same numbers drive Step 9, the saved invoice snapshot, Job Profitability
// and the unit tests — one calculation model, no duplicated formulas.
