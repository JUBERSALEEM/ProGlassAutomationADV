// DETECTS PROFIT FIGURES PRODUCED BY THE PRE-FIX DGU COSTING.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS TO SOLVE
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  Step 9's glass-pane regex used a lazy wildcard for the colour, which
//  crossed the '+' separating layers. On
//
//      "6mm HD Grey FT Glass + 12mm ASP + 6mm Clear FT Glass"
//
//  the second match began inside the SPACER and swallowed the inner pane,
//  so every double-glazed unit was costed on its outer pane alone. The
//  regex is fixed, but the P&L snapshot is written at SAVE time — so
//  every invoice saved before the fix still carries an understated cost
//  and an overstated profit.
//
//  Silently rewriting stored financial history would be worse than the
//  bug. Instead this identifies the affected records so they can be
//  recalculated deliberately, by a person.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  THE DETECTION SIGNATURE
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  A snapshot is suspect when a spec group is clearly a DGU (its spec
//  name contains an air spacer) yet contributed only ONE glass row.
//  Correctly costed DGUs always produce two — outer and inner.
//
//  This is a HEURISTIC over saved text, not a proof. It is deliberately
//  biased toward false negatives: it only flags what it can justify from
//  the stored rows, because telling someone their books are wrong when
//  they are not is its own kind of damage. See ScanSnapshot for the cases
//  it will not flag.
