// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  OptimizationResultFeed — read-only bridge from a finished optimization
//  run to the quoting steps.
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS
//  Step 6 WASTAGE CHARGE SETUP asks the operator to type a SHEET QTY and an
//  optimization %. Step 9 then drives its Sheet Details tab from exactly those
//  two numbers (see the "Senior ERP rule" comment in
//  SheetProfitabilityViewModel). But the optimization module already computes
//  both — per rack, from the real cut. Hand-copying them is where the quote
//  silently drifts from the plan.
//
//  HOW ROWS ARE JOINED
//  By (SpecNumber, Side), which both modules take from the SAME Step 5
//  SpecGroup: Step 6's SpecGroupColorSide.SpecNumber/SemanticSideLabel and the
//  optimization rack's imported spec/side. This is structural. Matching on
//  colour instead would be fragile — Step 6 deliberately allows a pane colour
//  to stay blank ("Unresolvable colours stay blank instead of becoming row
//  names"), so a colour join would drop rows without saying so.
//
//  THE SHARED-RACK CAVEAT (important, and the reason for IsSharedAcrossSpecs)
//  The engine groups pieces by COMPOSITION, not by spec. When two specs use the
//  same glass at the same sheet size they are cut from one pool, and after the
//  run there is no record of which sheet belonged to which spec. Utilization is
//  still exact — it is a property of the rack. Sheet quantity is not: it is the
//  shared total. This feed therefore reports the quantity once, flags it, and
//  leaves the split to Step6SheetAllocation's existing weighted allocation,
//  which was written for precisely that job. Inventing a per-spec split here
//  would double the buy.
//
//  LAYERING
//  Services must not reach into ViewModels, so this owns its own read model and
//  parses the persisted ResultJson. Three writers exist and their shapes
//  differ (this module writes List<ResultRowDto>; CuttingWorkflowService writes
//  an anonymous summary; ProductionOptimizationBridge writes "{}"), so parsing
//  is defensive and a foreign shape yields an empty feed rather than a crash.
//
//  STATE — PROCESS-WIDE BY DESIGN
//  Current is a cache over a persisted store, refreshed explicitly, and it
//  always carries a provenance label and a timestamp. That is deliberately NOT
//  the SpecSheetRegistry anti-pattern, where the static map was the only copy
//  of the data and a restart silently zeroed it.
//
//  It is static because "the latest optimization run" is process-wide truth:
//  the optimization module is a single global tool, not a per-invoice one, and
//  this mirrors SpecSheetRegistry and the other static caches in Services.
//  Two proforma windows would share one snapshot, which is the correct reading
//  of that fact rather than a leak.
//
//  Starting a NEW INVOICE deliberately does NOT clear this. The run still
//  happened; discarding it would make the feed useless for the common case of
//  cutting a job and then quoting it. The real hazard — applying one job's
//  figures to another — is handled by making the source unmistakable instead:
//  both switches are opt-in, per row, and every figure carries a provenance
//  label naming the run and when it happened.
//
//  Readers never see a torn snapshot: Set swaps an immutable-by-convention list
//  reference under the gate, so a reader holding the previous reference keeps
//  enumerating a complete list.
