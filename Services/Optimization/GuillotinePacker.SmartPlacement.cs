//  MODULE: Optimization — cutting engine, smart placement policy (2026-09-17)
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  The engine already searches hard: six orderings × three split rules,
//  sheet-fill, wall-seed, MaxRects, per-sheet best split and a beam over it.
//  What it did NOT have is a better answer to the question each of those
//  strategies asks at every single placement:
//
//      "Given this piece and these free rectangles, which one do I use?"
//
//  The legacy score is LOCAL — exact-edge fit, then best-short-side-fit, then
//  leftover area, all measured inside the one rectangle being consumed. It
//  never asks what the placement leaves the SHEET capable of, which is the
//  defining question in guillotine nesting: a small piece dropped into the
//  largest free rectangle splits it into two medium ones, while the same piece
//  dropped into a rectangle it nearly fills leaves the large one intact. Both
//  can score identically, and the first sheet wins the tie.
//
//  Two further things were forced rather than decided:
//
//    • the guillotine split direction is fixed for an entire run, even though
//      whether the remainder should go right or down is a per-placement choice;
//    • MarginProfile.MinBreakoutMm — the narrowest offcut the floor can
//      actually cut — was editable in MARGINS, persisted with the session and
//      even drawn in the 2D preview, but no code path honoured it. Commit kept
//      every remainder above zero as usable stock, so a plan could call for
//      cutting a 4 mm sliver out of a sheet. Glass does not do that; it breaks.
//
//  WHAT THIS DOES
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  PackSmart scores a placement by what SURVIVES it:
//
//    1. least area forced into uncuttable trim (breakout honoured first);
//    2. then the largest surviving contiguous free rectangle, by area;
//    3. then that rectangle's shortest side — a long thin survivor is much
//       less useful than a squarer one of the same area;
//    4. then the legacy geometry (exact-edge fit, best short side) as a
//       tie-break, so where capacity is equal this behaves like the engine
//       the owner calibrated;
//    5. then orientation, rectangle index and position — a total order, so
//       the run is deterministic.
//
//  Both split directions are evaluated at every placement, and the caller's
//  SplitMode becomes a PREFERENCE used only as a tie-break rather than a
//  constraint applied to the whole job.
//
//  SAFETY — WHY THIS CANNOT REGRESS A RESULT
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  It is an additional candidate, never a replacement. PackOptimize feeds it
//  through Better(), which keeps the minimum on unplaced, then sheets, then
//  utilization: a candidate can only win by being better. Every benchmark pin
//  in OptimizationBenchmarkTests is on PackQuick, which is untouched — the
//  split maths it uses is the same function with minBreakout = 0, which
//  reproduces the previous behaviour exactly.
//
//  Placements are committed through the SAME Commit and the SAME SplitRemainder
//  as every other strategy, so the oracle's guarantees (no overlap, kerf
//  respected, inside the margin zone) hold by construction rather than by
//  parallel implementation.
//
//  COST
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Roughly four split evaluations per (piece, rectangle, orientation) instead
//  of one, on a sheet-at-a-time pass. That is why it is gated: it runs at
//  effort 2 and above, once in the Large band, and not at all in the Huge band
//  where termination matters more than the last sheet.
