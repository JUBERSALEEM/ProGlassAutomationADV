// PROJECT: ProGlassAutomation
// MODULE: Core — document delete/void/edit lifecycle policy (ERP hardening)
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
//   Every document delete in the app was a physical row delete, including
//   posted Tax Invoices — a fiscal/compliance failure (an issued invoice
//   must be retained, not erased; it is corrected by a credit note). There
//   was also no single authority for "may this document's body still be
//   edited?" — InvoiceLifecycleStateMachine.IsEditable existed but was
//   enforced nowhere.
//
//   This class is the SINGLE authority for three questions, matching the
//   §3 matrix in docs/ERP_LIFECYCLE_HARDENING_ANALYSIS_2026-09-09.md:
//
//     • CanHardDelete(kind, status, hasChildren)
//         → true  = a childless pre-posting DRAFT: safe to physically delete
//         → false = posted / has children: must be VOIDED, never deleted
//
//     • CanEditBody(kind, status)
//         → true  = still a working draft: line items / totals editable
//         → false = posted: body frozen, only status transitions allowed
//                   (correct it via Cancel/Void or a Credit Note)
//
//     • VoidTargetStatus(kind)
//         → the terminal "soft-closed" status a Void writes for each kind
//           (Cancelled for PI/TI-cancel path, Rejected for JO, Cancelled
//           for DN). Kept here so repositories don't hard-code it.
//
// DESIGN RULES (mirrors StatusTransitions.cs):
//   • Pure, static, testable — no database, no WPF, never throws.
//   • Reuses StatusTransitions.Kind so there is ONE document-kind vocabulary.
//   • Case-insensitive status matching, tolerant of null/blank (unknown or
//     blank status is treated as NOT hard-deletable and NOT editable — the
//     safe default for a fiscal document is "protect it").
//   • The status sets are deliberately CONSERVATIVE: only genuinely
//     pre-posting states are hard-deletable / body-editable, so enforcing
//     this can never silently destroy or rewrite a committed document.
