// MODULE: Optimization — lifetime teardown (partial of OptimizationViewModel)
//
// PHASE 6 / findings 11 and 13 (2026-09-20).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//   OptimizationViewModel owned three things that outlive it and had no way to
//   release any of them:
//
//     • _runClock, a DispatcherTimer (Progress.cs). A DispatcherTimer is rooted
//       by the WPF Dispatcher while it is RUNNING, and its Tick handler is an
//       instance method — so a live timer is a strong root to the entire view
//       model: Pieces, Stocks, AvailableJobs, _groupRuns, _flatSheets. It was
//       stopped in exactly one place, RunCoreAsync's finally, which is correct
//       for the normal and exceptional run paths but leaves nothing to fall back
//       on if the run is never entered (StartRunClock fires in Run() on the UI
//       thread, RunCoreAsync is reached through SafeFireAndForget) or if the VM
//       is replaced mid-run.
//
//     • _runCts and _bridgeCts, two CancellationTokenSources. Both were disposed
//       on some paths (Run.cs, Phase14.cs) and leaked on others.
//
//     • PropertyChanged handlers attached to every job in AvailableJobs and
//       every pane layer in JobSpecBreakdown. Those were detached only when the
//       collections were rebuilt, never on teardown.
//
//   The headless Step 5 host made this worse from the other side: it is a full
//   OptimizationViewModel, and ProformaInvoiceViewModel subscribed to its
//   PropertyChanged without ever unsubscribing — so the host rooted all nine
//   wizard step VMs. See the matching change in ProformaInvoiceViewModel.Dispose.
//
//   ViewModelBase implements only INotifyPropertyChanged, so IDisposable is
//   introduced here rather than overridden.
