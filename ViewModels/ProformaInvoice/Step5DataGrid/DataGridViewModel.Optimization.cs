//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  QUICK / OPTIMIZE on the Step 5 top panel, so a cut plan can be produced
//  from the grid the operator is actually looking at instead of requiring a
//  confirmed Job Order on the OPTIMIZATION tab. Step 6 then reads sheet qty
//  and utilization from the run rather than from hand-typed numbers.
//
//  LAYERING
//  This grid does not reference the optimization module. It snapshots its own
//  data and hands it to a delegate the composer (ProformaInvoiceViewModel)
//  binds — the same late-bound idiom already used for Step 4 pricing
//  (BindStep4Pricing) and the Step 6 feed (BindOptimizationFeed). One writer,
//  many readers, no new constructor arguments on a DI-resolved view model.
//
//  NO EXISTING CODE PATH IS ALTERED
//  The commands are created lazily on first binding rather than assigned in
//  InitializeCore, so the shared two-phase initialization that ERR-633EEB
//  hardened is not touched.
